## ⚠️ Warning

Never blindly trust remote scripts from others. `Git Pipeline` is for personal and development use only — not recommended for team environments or production.

## Git Pipeline

A simple way to standardize your commits across all projects.

1. Create your own repo with the script content.
2. In each local project, create a file named `git-pipeline.sh` with the following content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script-cloud/script-cloud/main/scripts/git/git-pipeline.sh | bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user|org>/<repo>/<branch>/git/git-pipeline.sh | bash
```

3. If you update the source, all projects get the same commit pattern automatically — no manual changes needed.

Then run:
```sh
sh ./git-pipeline.sh
```
